      Which is obviously a fake name. The real me is a 20-something software
      engineer.  I dropped out of college when I was a teenager, taught myself
      to code, and have been programming for almost all of my 20's. I'm
      currently a senior software engineer at a start up in Silicon Valley. I'm
      currently building an agency-as-a-product.


      Having tried multiple attempts at entrepeneurship, I am making this blog
      to document my journey from starting at 0 while my company is starting up
      and I am still working a full-time job, to eventually getting to
      $100k/month in profit. I plan on achieving this by building a lead
      generation company selling and renting local lead generation websites.
