      Which is obviously a fake name, an alter-ego if you will. The real me is a
      20-something software engineer.  I dropped out of college when I was a
      teenager, taught myself to code, and have been programming for most of my
      20's. 


      Having tried multiple attempts at entrepeneurship, I am making this blog
      to document my journey from starting to $100k/month in profit. I plan on
      achieving this by building a lead generation company selling and renting
      local lead generation websites.
